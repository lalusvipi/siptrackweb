## Views and Objects

You can separate all your objects with views for clients or projects. Each view has a hierarchical object-tree database that can contain folders and devices.

## Visualized Racks

Siptrackweb visualizes devices of class "rack" and each Unit is a sub-device that can be linked to another device.
